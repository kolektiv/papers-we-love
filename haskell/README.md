* [Making a Fast Curry: Push/Enter vs. Eval/Apply for Higher-order Languages](../haskell/making-a-fast-curry-push-enter-versus-eval-apply-for-higher-order-languages.pdf) by Simon Marlow and Simon Peyton Jones. A classic... describes well the execution model GHC uses for Haskell, and catches the brilliant authors in a design pivot from original intuition to new conclusions based on empirical data.
